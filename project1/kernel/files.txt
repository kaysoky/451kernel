/arch/x86/syscalls/syscall_32.tbl
/arch/x86/syscalls/syscall_64.tbl
    Two add the system call, it was necessary to add to the system call table.
    Although both are modified, only the 64-bit code is used. 
    
/fs/exec.c
    Since this is where the execve system call is defined, 
    we needed to add a hook to our execcnts helper method.
    
/include/linux/execcnts.h
    We decided to increment the exec counts with a common helper method.
    This file contains that method and the 4 possible counters (as indices).
    
/include/linux/sched.h
    To keep track of the exec counts, we needed to extend the PCB.
    
/include/linux/syscalls.h
    This is where we defined the new execcnts system call.
    
/kernel/Makefile
    To have the new system call build and link, we needed to add it to the makefile.
    
/kernel/execcnts.c
    This contains the implementation of the system call 
    and the associated helper method used to increment the counts.

/kernel/fork.c 
    Since this is where the fork, vfork, and clone system calls are defined, 
    we needed to add a hook to our execcnts helper method.
